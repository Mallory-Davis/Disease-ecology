This EpiTriad shows the relationships between the environment, host and pathogen. The EpiTriad is the best understanding of disease ecology.

**Worksheet 2 9/22/25**

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

**Answer**: 147 Deer

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

**Answer**: 299 samples

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

**Answer:** 229 samples

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%

**Answer**: \<1%

**Worksheet 3 10/7/25**

Janâ€™s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10^th^ June 2025. She meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows:

RE: red eyes; OD: ocular discharge; NAD: no abnormality detected

Recovered elk are immune (not susceptible) to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25.

Show your work.

1\) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

**Answer:** 5/51= 9.8% new cases per susceptible animal per day, 2/44= 4.5% new cases per susceptible animal per day, 0/42= 0% new cases per susceptible day

2\) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence.

**Answer:** 12/56=21.42% cases per total population, 5/56= 8.92% cases per total population

3\) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?

**Answer:** 1/56= 1.78%

4\) On which day is the incidence lowest?

**Answer:** 6/15 and 6/16 because they are both at zero
