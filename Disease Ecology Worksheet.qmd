**Worksheet 4 (10/23/25)**

**MERS-CoV**

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is mostly found in camels (dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to humans. Limited human-to-human transmission can occur after close contact and has resulted in health care–associated outbreaks. Human MERS-CoV infection can cause severe respiratory illness; approximately 35% of reported MERS cases have died.

![](images/clipboard-3333916480.png)

Which of the following statements about MERS-CoV are correct? *(If it is incorrect, provide an explanation why the statement is incorrect.)*

1.  MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (2 points)

    **Answer:** This is incorrect. MERS-CoV is primarily found and maintained in camels. The only human cases are caused from direct contact with an infected camel.

2.  Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. (2 points)

    **Answer:** This statement is correct!

3.  Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. (2 points)

    **Answer:** This statement is correct!

4.  The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%. (2 points)

    **Answer:** This is incorrect. The case-fatality rate is 35% for humans.

5.  The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak. (2 points)

    **Answer:** This is incorrect because this outbreak is over multiple years, unlike a point source outbreak. A point source outbreak is an outbreak over a very short period of time.

**Worksheet 5 (11/3/25)**

**Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024** The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.

1.  Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.

    **Answer:** This would be a spillover event because the first case(s) were known to have come from the Egyptian Rousette bats. These bats were the known reservoir of this virus. Then, once this virus came into contact with the humans- especially the one's who were healthcare worker, which shows that it transmits with close contact/interaction.

<!-- -->

2.  What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?

    **Answer:** Communtiy measures that could be implemented include wildlife awareness. This would allow for people to understand the dangers of contact with bats (and other wildlife animals) and how to properly handle or not handle them. This awareness would also need to discuss the diseases said animals could carry and transmit to humans.

    Healthcare measures that could be implemented would include protective clothing/equipment and isolation. This would protect the healthcare workers and the human with the disease. Healthcare workers would need to wear gloves, shoe coverings, hair coverings and a jacket/coat of some sort that would get resterilized in between patients. Isolation of patients would help lower the risk of infection for not only healthcare workers but other patients/visitors in the hospital. If properly isolated, the spread of the disease would be very small.

**Worksheet 7 (11/17/25)**

1.  Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive measures recommended in each setting.

    **Answer:** In Malaysia the main mode of transmission is from fruit bats contaminating pig enclosures. This makes human to human transmission low due to having to have close contact with infected pigs. Not everyone owns or is near pig farms, so it is hard to have human to human transmission, and quarantine an infected human. To take preventative measures, Malaysia can implement biosecurity measures on pig farms. This could mean culling infected pigs, separating contaminated ones, and keeping bats out of the area as much as possible. In Bangladesh, the main mode of transmission is contaminated raw date palm sap with saliva or urine from bats. This makes human to human transmission higher because it leads to more infections through respiratory secretions. In Balngladesh a preventative measure taken could be blocking bats from contaminating the collection pots. This could be done by having a cover around/over these pots.

2.  Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes? Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe its impact on the affected population.

    **Answer:** ARV has two transmission routes-Horizontal and Vertical. Horizontal transmission routes include Fecal/oral spread or contaminated litter, water or feed. Vertical transmission includes infected breeder hens laying an egg (which makes the egg contaminated). Environmental factors include unclean litter that is contaminated, high bird density, or a humid hen house. This virus can survive outside the natural reservoir (it is very hardy), meaning it can live and survive in dirty litter. This would support the fecal-oral route, which ARV strives in. Tenosynovitis is caused by ARV. This disease is mostly seem in wild turkeys. It causes swollen joints and less mobility. This causes an impact in wild turkey population due to a decreased survival rate and struggles for foraging.

3.  Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China. Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV classified as a spillover and not a potential EID?

    **Answer:** The reservoir for LayV is likely shrews. The modes of transmission include direct contact, exposure to contaminated feces or urine or even from an infected animal bite. This is only considered a spillover because there is no known human to human transmission and no geographic expansion.

**Worksheet 8 (11/19/25)**

Raccoon Roundworm (Baylisascaris procyonis) data interpretation

**Answer:** In the North, 27 raccoon's were infected with roundworms and 16 were uninfected, while in the South, 14 were infected and 35 were uninfected. This represents a clear difference in infection rates between the two regions. The North had a prevalence of 62.8%, whereas the South had a much lower prevalence of 28.6%. This suggests that raccoon's in the South experience lower exposure to roundworms, greater resistance, or environmental conditions that are less suitable for the parasite’s transmission. The north on the other hand might have a lower resistance, higher exposure or an environment that these parasites thrive in, causing the prevalence rate to be much higher.

1.  In 2024, a multistate Salmonella outbreak was linked to backyard poultry flocks in the United States. What specific human behaviors contributed to the zoonotic spread of Salmonella? In your response, identify at least three practices by backyard poultry owners that increased the risk of Salmonella transmission, and briefly explain why these behaviors facilitated human infection.

    **Answer:** Several human behaviors by backyard poultry owners increased the risk of zoonotic Salmonella transmission in the 2024 multistate outbreak. Here are just some of the many reasons:\
    Young children often hug or kiss birds and then put their hands in their mouths. Because poultry commonly shed Salmonella in their feathers and feces, poor hand hygiene enables direct ingestion of the bacteria, especially in young children.\
    Salmonella survives for long periods in organic material like litter and soil. Poor and infrequent cleaning increases environmental contamination and raises the risk of human exposure during routine care.\
    Backyard flocks are often accessible to wild birds and rodents, which can introduce or spread Salmonella. Humans handling contaminated surfaces without proper equipment leads to a greater risk of infection.

    1.  Tall fescue grass is commonly infected with a fungal endophyte (Epichloë coenophiala) that produces ergot alkaloids associated with fescue toxicosis in grazing livestock.

        a.  What advantage does Tall fescue gain from being infected with a fungal endophyte?

        **Answer:** The fungal endophyte provides tall fescue with greater stress tolerance, including: enhanced drought resistance, improved heat tolerance, greater resistance to insect herbivory (alkaloids deter insects), increased persistence and competitiveness in overgrazed or nutrient-poor soils. These benefits help tall fescue dominate pastures and survive harsh environmental conditions.

        b.  What environmental and ecological factors drive the occurrence and severity of fescue toxicosis in grazing systems?

        **Answer:** Fescue toxicosis is incredibly durable, drought resistant and can grow rapidly, making it tolerant to overgrazing. This is why tescue toxicosis is common in the southern states, where it is warm and we often experience droughts. Due to the rapid fescue growth, it is easy for it to over take fields, making it the only grazing option for cattle.

        c\. What are the key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle?

        **Answer:** Clinical signs are most commonly seen as weight loss, dull and discolored hair, and poor performance.

**Worksheet 10 (11/25/25)**

1\. What are the different routes of transmission for African Swine fever? What role do\
humans play in the spread and transmission of ASF?

**Answer:** The routes of transmission for ASF include direct contact (pig to pig through ingfected feces, saliva and urine), contaminated objects like clothing, shoes, or infected pigs sharing water with other pigs, wild pigs coming in contact with domesticated pigs. Humans spread ASF through the movement of infected pigs, infected raw/undercooked pork products being fed to humans or other pigs, or even through poor biosecurity measures (not disinfecting or no quarantining new pigs).

**2. Describe how co-infection with Koala retrovirus (KoRV) affects the severity,\
progression, and management of Chlamydia in koalas.

**Answer:** KoRV (similar to HIV in humans) suppresses the immune system in Koala's. Due to the weakened immune system, this make the chlamydia symptoms worse, increase infertility and mortality rates. This also leads to an increase in UTI's and respiratory disease in koala's. These can often be asymptomatic, so quarantining is not always an easy option.

3\. Snake Fungal Disease (SFD), caused by Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola, is an emerging\
threat to wild snake populations in North America. What are the key challenges associated with the surveillance and management of Snake Fungal Disease (SFD)?

**Answer:** A main key challenge in management of SFD is the lack of symptoms. Snakes are usually asymptomatic at first, which once again leads to a increase risk of exposure to other snakes. While there is a test (qPRC-dna test) to determine if a snake is positive for SFD, this test frequently gives a false negatives. This is hard to control and manage what snakes are infected and diseases and which are not. Since the main transmission is through contact and shared refuge, this virus is constantly infecting other snakes.
