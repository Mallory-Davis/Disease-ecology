**Lab Report 1 (10-15-25)**

In this lab we looked at and discussed ticks. I am going to focus on the final tick we observed, which was a lone star tick. We looked for the four identifying/life stage methods. The first method we observed was the number of legs. The tick observed had 8 legs, which means it is an adult tick/nymph. Next we observed if there was an obvious genital pore, this was present. Next we observed for a conscutum, once again was present as well as having a posterior anal groove. This showed us that the lone star tick we were observing is a male. In the lab we saw that the tick had a hard, shiny shell. This was very interesting to view and see the two differences between the ticks and the reasoning why.

Question 7.

In 2015, a mass die-off of Saiga antelope occurred in Kazakhstan, resulting in the deaths of over 200,000 animals within a short period. Briefly describe the proximate cause of this extraordinary mortality event and explain how it led to such large-scale deaths. What measures could be implemented to prevent similar mortality events in the future? Finally, discuss broader conservation strategies that could help safeguard Saiga antelopes from extension due to disease outbreaks.

**Answer:** The proximate cause of this mass die-off is a type B infection- Pasteurella multocida. While usually a harmless bacteria- the weather during this time was also extremely warm and humid- which is a breeding ground for bacteria. This caused the bacteria to multiply quickly. Antelope are herd animals, so there are many around at a time. This was a quick and easy way for the disease out spread within the herd. It was difficult for herd immunity to take effect, because the result in this disease was death, so they were unable to build an immunity to it. In order to prevent similar events, there must be habitat management, for example, limiting human interactions or outside stress-enhancing scenarios. We also need to enhance the use of disease surveillance. This would result in a monitoring of the antelopes and the environment they are surrounding themselves in. Broader conservation strategies would include helping maintain the population by either captive breeding or having multiple separate herds to help the growth of population.

**Worksheet 4 (10-23-25)**

**MERS-CoV**

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is mostly found in camels (dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to humans. Limited human-to-human transmission can occur after close contact and has resulted in health care–associated outbreaks. Human MERS-CoV infection can cause severe respiratory illness; approximately 35% of reported MERS cases have died.

![](images/clipboard-3333916480.png)

Which of the following statements about MERS-CoV are correct? *(If it is incorrect, provide an explanation why the statement is incorrect.)*

1.  MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (2 points)

    **Answer:** This is incorrect. MERS-CoV is primarily found and maintained in camels. The only human cases are caused from direct contact with an infected camel.

2.  Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. (2 points)

    **Answer:** This statement is correct!

3.  Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. (2 points)

    **Answer:** This statement is correct!

4.  The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%. (2 points)

    **Answer:** This is incorrect. The case-fatality rate is 35% for humans.

5.  The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak. (2 points)

    **Answer:** This is incorrect because this outbreak is over multiple years, unlike a point source outbreak. A point source outbreak is an outbreak over a very short period of time.

**Worksheet 5 (11-3-25)**

**Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024** The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.

1.  Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.

**Answer:** This would be a spillover event because the first case(s) were known to have come from the Egyptian Rousette bats. These bats were the known reservoir of this virus. Then, once this virus came into contact with the humans- especially the one's who were healthcare worker, which shows that it transmits with close contact/interaction.

2.  What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?

**Answer:**

Communtiy measures that could be implemented include wildlife awareness. This would allow for people to understand the dangers of contact with bats (and other wildlife animals) and how to properly handle or not handle them. This awareness would also need to discuss the diseases said animals could carry and transmit to humans.

Healthcare measures that could be implemented would include protective clothing/equipment and isolation. This would protect the healthcare workers and the human with the disease. Healthcare workers would need to wear gloves, shoe coverings, hair coverings and a jacket/coat of some sort that would get resterilized in between patients. Isolation of patients would help lower the risk of infection for not only healthcare workers but other patients/visitors in the hospital. If properly isolated, the spread of the disease would be very small.

**Worksheet 6 (11-10-25)**

**Pond 1**

Prevalence: 30%

95% Cl: 14-52.5%

**Pond 2**

Prevalence: 6.7%

95% Cl: 0.3-30.2%

**Overall**

Fisher's exact test p-value: 0.1987

**Interpretation**: The infection rate of Vertico is higher in pond 1 than it is in pond 2. Our p-value is 0.1987 which is greater than 0.05. This data shows that the prevalence difference is not significant based on a 0.05 level.
