Recovered elk are immune (not susceptible) to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25.

Show your work.

1\) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

**Answer:** 5/51= 9.8% new cases per susceptible animal per day, 2/44= 4.5% new cases per susceptible animal per day, 0/42= 0% new cases per susceptible day

2\) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence.

**Answer:** 12/56=21.42% cases per total population, 5/56= 8.92% cases per total population

3\) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?

**Answer:** 1/56= 1.78%

4\) On which day is the incidence lowest?

**Answer:** 6/15 and 6/16 because they are both at zero

**Lab Report 1 (10-15-25)**

In this lab we looked at and discussed ticks. I am going to focus on the final tick we observed, which was a lone star tick. We looked for the four identifying/life stage methods. The first method we observed was the number of legs. The tick observed had 8 legs, which means it is an adult tick/nymph. Next we observed if there was an obvious genital pore, this was present. Next we observed for a conscutum, once again was present as well as having a posterior anal groove. This showed us that the lone star tick we were observing is a male. In the lab we saw that the tick had a hard, shiny shell. This was very interesting to view and see the two differences between the ticks and the reasoning why.

Question 7.

In 2015, a mass die-off of Saiga antelope occurred in Kazakhstan, resulting in the deaths of over 200,000 animals within a short period. Briefly describe the proximate cause of this extraordinary mortality event and explain how it led to such large-scale deaths. What measures could be implemented to prevent similar mortality events in the future? Finally, discuss broader conservation strategies that could help safeguard Saiga antelopes from extension due to disease outbreaks.

**Answer:** The proximate cause of this mass die-off is a type B infection- Pasteurella multocida. While usually a harmless bacteria- the weather during this time was also extremely warm and humid- which is a breeding ground for bacteria. This caused the bacteria to multiply quickly. Antelope are herd animals, so there are many around at a time. This was a quick and easy way for the disease out spread within the herd. It was difficult for herd immunity to take effect, because the result in this disease was death, so they were unable to build an immunity to it. In order to prevent similar events, there must be habitat management, for example, limiting human interactions or outside stress-enhancing scenarios. We also need to enhance the use of disease surveillance. This would result in a monitoring of the antelopes and the environment they are surrounding themselves in. Broader conservation strategies would include helping maintain the population by either captive breeding or having multiple separate herds to help the growth of population.

Question 10.

Steve studies a population of the Suwanee Alligator Snapping turtle in Florida. He has been conducting a mark-recapture study of this population since 2010. Since 2015, he has documented cases of cutaneous fibroma in this population. The following data collected by Steve:

Turtles without visible fibroma are considered susceptible to the disease.

**Answer:**

2015: 4/133- 3.01%

2016: 7/125- 5.60%
